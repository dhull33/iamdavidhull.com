          I will not insult your intelligence by telling you my name here-now in this paragraph-since, more than
          likely, you have already gathered it.
          After all, my name is all over this very website. Nor will I go into detail about my life before software
          developmentBe
          that as it
          may, I will
          tell you
          what follows
          below.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          I am a <span class="highlight-node">Node.js</span> and <span class="highlight-node">JavaScript</span>
          software engineer.
          Nothing else.
          You might ask me, ‚ÄúBut David, how can that
          be good for your career?‚Äù I would respond, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably not. Howbeit, I love Node.js and JavaScript, so I
          made it my life‚Äôs work.‚Äù That‚Äôs a bit romantic, right? The complete truth, however, is much more relatable for most developers - I got tired of knowing very little of very many technologies. Although I do love Node.js and JavaScript, I cannot rule out the reason of my love being the fact most of my exposure is with those two technologies. It certainly may have turned out differently if I had been raised in a traditional computer science home. Nevertheless I was not and have instead taken a rather perilous and frustratingly slow journey through the great mountains of computer science. I do not know if it is possible to conquer this tremendous sierra, but I do know there is no hope if I keep visiting every village I may cross paths with - for their numbers are vast and all promise shelter from the cold, a soft bed, and food to satisfy my ever ravenous curiosity. Rather, I shall sleep in the cold and face the winds of the mountains with Node.js and JavaScript hand-in-hand until we perish amongst the rocks or triumphantly summit the last peak.
